Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile
--------------------------------------

We cannot provide the official remotion.snk keyfile, so you will need to 
create your own.
To do so, simply run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, you will need to make 
sure the .NET SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Relinq
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.


Building re-linq from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Relinq.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.

Running the tests you can use:
* NUnit GUI (available on http://nunit.org/, free stand-alone application)
* Visual Studio's integrated Test Explorer
  To run the tests with Test Explorer, you must install the free "NUnit Test Adapter" extension. 
  Use the "Extensions and Updates..." menu item under the "Tools" menu to do this.
* JetBrains ReSharper Test Runner (https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper, commercial product)
* Test Driven .NET (http://testdriven.net/, commercial product)

Building re-linq with MSBuild
-------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build.cmd from your working 
directory and use option #2 (Full Build, includes NuGet packages):

cd c:\Relinq
Build.cmd

To generate documentation files for re-linq, run Build.cmd 
and use option #3 (Docs Build).
This requires Sandcastle Help File Builder to be installed, see below. 

Installing Sandcastle Help File Builder for the documentation build
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation package of the version of Sandcastle Help File Builder used by
re-motion is located in the prereq folder, under the following path: 

https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/tags/1.16.0/prereq/Tools/SandcastleHelpFileBuilderInstall/v1.9.5.0/
Note: v1.9.5.0 is no longer available on https://shfb.codeplex.com or https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB; 
the closest official download (v1.9.7.0) is available at https://shfb.codeplex.com/releases/view/99462.

Run Sandcastle Installer and click through the wizard.
- When asked whether to proceed without the Microsoft Help 2 Compiler 
  installed, click "Yes".
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Tools, click "Install Sandcastle".
- Also install the Sandcastle Patch by clicking "Apply Patch" from the
  appropriate wizard page.
- No additional language packs are required to build the re-motion
  documentation.
- The MAML guide, Web Project Custom Code Providers, HTML to MAML converter,
  and MAML Schema Intellisense may be helpful for writing documentation, but
  are NOT required for the re-motion build.
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Help File Builder, click "Install SHFB".
