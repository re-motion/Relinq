Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile
--------------------------------------

We cannot provide the official remotion.snk keyfile, so you will need to 
create your own.
To do so, simply run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, you will need to make 
sure the .NET SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Relinq
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.


Building re-linq from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Relinq.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.


Building re-linq with MSBuild
-------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build.cmd from your working 
directory and use option #2 (Full Build, includes NuGet packages):

cd c:\Relinq
Build.cmd

To generate documentation files for re-linq, run Build.cmd 
and use option #3 (Docs Build).
This requires Sandcastle Help File Builder to be installed, see below. 

Installing Sandcastle Help File Builder for the documentation build
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation package of the version of Sandcastle Help File Builder used by
re-motion is located in the prereq folder, under the following path: 

https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/tags/1.16.0/prereq/Tools/SandcastleHelpFileBuilderInstall/v1.9.5.0/

Run Sandcastle Installer and click through the wizard.
- When asked whether to proceed without the Microsoft Help 2 Compiler 
  installed, click "Yes".
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Tools, click "Install Sandcastle".
- Also install the Sandcastle Patch by clicking "Apply Patch" from the
  appropriate wizard page.
- No additional language packs are required to build the re-motion
  documentation.
- The MAML guide, Web Project Custom Code Providers, HTML to MAML converter,
  and MAML Schema Intellisense may be helpful for writing documentation, but
  are NOT required for the re-motion build.
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Help File Builder, click "Install SHFB".
